# Manual test: force-rename-fail
# NOTE: This script is a manual/outside test harness for development and should not
# be invoked automatically by the regression runner. It demonstrates how to force
# and inspect fallback behavior locally by manipulating the environment or by
# locking the target file externally (e.g., using a separate process).
# Keep as a reference for manual debugging only.
